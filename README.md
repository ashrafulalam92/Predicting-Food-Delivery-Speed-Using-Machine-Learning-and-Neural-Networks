# Predicting-Food-Delivery-Speed-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Neural-Networks


Built a machine learning model to predict food delivery speed using a dataset of 9,000+ entries
Applied data cleaning, feature encoding, scaling, and trained models including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Neural Network(MLP)
Achieved highest accuracy with a custom neural network and evaluated performance using classification metrics and ROC curves
